        Space is pretty, deep and mysterious.
        We are all made up of star stuff and the idea that
        the stuff came together to form us is amazing.
        I also find it thrilling because it is unknown if there
        is life on other planets.

        No one really introduced me to space.
        Iâ€™ve always liked to look at the night sky.
        The moon is what inspired me to learn more about space.
        I think that's just because it's the closest celestial body
        that I can observe in detail without a telescope.

        Stars and NASA continue to inspire me.
        I love finding new stars that I haven't noticed before.
        Especially since there is a lot of light pollution in the city,
        it's very awe-inspiring when I am able to see more stars.
        I love the work that NASA does and how they share a lot of their
        knowledge with the public.

    <ul> <em>To reiterate...</em>
        <li> It's beautiful</li>

        <li>It's mind blowing</li>

        <li> It's us</li>
